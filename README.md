# Shopping-Cart

## Description 

An exercise with MIT xPro that's a shopping cart and a store that can be restocked with a call to a Strapi database. Along with a check out that keeps track of your total. 

## How To Run

After loading in a browser window, browse through the produce and click submit. Your choice will be added to the cart and the check out will be updated with the total. You can also click on an item in the cart to see the cost and origin and click again to delete it from the cart. Click ReStock Products to replenish the store. 

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

I would like to update the styles, layout, and the UI so its clearer and easier to use.
